GNU General Public License
==========================

### 7. Additional Terms

“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional
permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they
were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable
law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be
used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any
additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional
permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you
modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a
covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a
covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material)
supplement the terms of this License with terms:

* **a)** Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of
sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
* **b)** Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author
attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works
containing it; or
* **c)** Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that
modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the
original version; or
* **d)** Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the
material; or
* **e)** Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names,
trademarks, or service marks; or
* **f)** Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone
who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of
liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions
directly impose on those licensors and authors.

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further
restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received
it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License
along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a
license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying
under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of
that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such
relicensing or conveying.

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in
the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those
files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a
separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply
either way.
